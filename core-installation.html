        <h2 class="installingfnv">Installation Parameters:</h2>      
        <p class="moddesc">
          - Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 3, and all modding tools must be installed outside all default Windows folders (<strong>Program Files</strong>, <strong>Program Files (x86)</strong>, <strong>Desktop</strong>, and <strong>Documents</strong> for example)
              <ul class="specialinstructions">
                <li>This is to avoid issues with Windows UAC (User Account Control) from blocking certain aspects of different tools</li>
              </ul>
        </p>
            <p class="moddesc">
              - Fallout New Vegas and Mod Organizer 2 must be installed on the same drive, preferably on an SSD for shorter loading times and less stutter while loading assets
                  <ul class="specialinstructions">
                    <li>Fallout 3 can be installed on any drive (still outside of the default Windows folders), because it can be uninstalled after installing TTW</li>
                  </ul>
              </p>  
            <p class="moddesc">
              - You will need at least 22GB gigabytes of free drive space for just the FNV, FO3, and the TTW Installer. The total size of the entire guide is 16 gigabytes (including the game and all the tools, excluding Fallout 3 since it can be uninstalled after installing TTW)
