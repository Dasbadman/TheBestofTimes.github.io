        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>10/24/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Updated NVTF INI instructions per the new update <br>
                - Added Heap Replacer to Utilities <br>
                - This is probably gonna be controversial, but its gonna save me a lot of headache. Removed DarnUI support for the Essentials section (was becoming way to much of a PITA to manage both sections, especially with how little time I have now and the additions of Vanilla HUD Cleaned and the new VUI+ patch in Consistent Pip-Boy Icons which is enabled by default) <br>
                - Added Vanilla HUD Cleaned to HUD/UI <br>
                - Updated Consistent Pip-Boy Icons FOMOD instructions to select the plugin (changes are now scripted so it is conflict-free) <br>
                - Removed Vanilla HUD Remastered and the Vanilla HUD Remastered - VUI+ Patch (not needed with the new Vanilla HUD Cleaned mod + the new VUI+ patch in the Consistent Pip-Boy Icons FOMOD) <br>
                - Removed Ammo Count Memory from Optional (new version of Stewie's Tweaks includes the same features at an engine level) <br>
                - Replaced Hitman's animations mods in Optional with his new Anniversary Anims Pack (includes his old anim mods and more) <br>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>9/10/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Fun update, pretty much just un-did all the changes from last update (realized that TTW's meshes are in BSAs, so you can't just use Sniff on them without extracting the meshes from the BSA. That really wouldn't be too hard, but I felt like it was too complex for this guide which is aimed more towards beginners) <br>
                - Updated Iron Sights Recoil Animations installation instructions to point to the old TTW version, rather than the new main file <br>
            </p>
            <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>9/09/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added Sniff to the Utilities section (now needed for patching Iron Sights Recoil Animations with TTW) <br>
                - Updated the Iron Sights Recoil Animations installation instructions in the optional section (now requires manual patching with Sniff) <br>
            </p>
            <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>8/31/20</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Added a note to disable <strong>bReplaceHashingAlgorithm</strong> in the NVTF.ini
            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>8/16/20</strong></p>
        <p class="moddesc">
            - Removed Universal Item Sorter and Weapon Mod Menu (redundant with new Stewie's Tweaks update) <br>
            - Updated NVTF settings for the newest version of NVTF
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>6/19/20</strong></p>

                - Initial release! <br>
